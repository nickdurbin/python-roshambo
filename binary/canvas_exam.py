# In a binary (base 2) number system, the places are sequential powers of 2:

# 2^0 = 1
# 2^1 = 2
# 2^2 = 4
# 2^3 = 8
# So, what if "101" was in binary? What would it represent then? Well, if we read it right to left, we have a "1" in the ones place, a "0" in the twos place, and a "1" in the fours place. We add these values up (4 + 0 + 1) which equals 5.

# Below, is a table that shows how to count up to 12 in binary and decimal:

# Decimal	Binary
# 0	0000
# 1	0001
# 2	0010
# 3	0011
# 4	0100
# 5	0101
# 6	0110
# 7	0111
# 8	1000
# 9	1001
# 10	1010
# 11	1011
# 12	1100
# Challenge
# Convert the following decimal numbers into binary numbers:

# 25 0001 1001
# 63 0011 1111
# 9 1001
# 111 0110 1110
